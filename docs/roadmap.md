# Diamond roadmap

Milestones describe executable capabilities. Research priorities may reorder
future work.

## Completed foundation

### Frontend and bytecode

- Source spans and caret diagnostics.
- Pratt expression compiler with direct register-bytecode emission.
- Debug/release builds and bounds-safe bytecode disassembly.
- Inline (`-e`) and file execution.
- Comments, semicolon separators, digit separators, and trailing commas.

### Dynamic language core

- Integers with checked arithmetic, booleans, `nil`, and strings.
- Locals, assignment, comparisons, expression-valued `if` and `while`.
- Ruby-style truthiness and value-preserving `!`, `&&`, and `||`.
- Explicit `return`, `break`, and `next` with nested control-flow targeting.
- Named functions, positional parameters, recursion, arity checks, and isolated
  register frames.

### Objects

- Classes, constructors, instances, fields, methods, and explicit `self`.
- Single inheritance, overriding, inherited constructors/fields, and lexically
  anchored `super(arguments)`.
- Dynamic receiver dispatch through class metadata.

### Managed collections

- Strings with concatenation and value equality.
- Arrays with literals, printing, indexed reads and writes, and bounds errors.
- Hashes with literals, value-key lookup, missing-key `nil`, insertion,
  replacement, growth, and printing.
- Stop-the-world mark/sweep collection with explicit frame roots and recursive
  tracing of instances and collections.
- Stress collection before every eligible allocation.

### Gradual typing

- Optional parameter and return annotations.
- `Int`, `String`, `Bool`, `Nil`, `Array`, `Hash`, and nominal class types.
- Subtype-aware class checks and compact `Type | Nil` unions.
- Guards on every implicit and explicit typed return path.
- Exact local type facts that remove proven guards and reject proven errors.
- Detailed expected/actual runtime type diagnostics.
- Per-instruction source coordinates in bytecode dumps.
- Source-mapped runtime stack traces across functions and methods.
- First-class nested closures with escaping, shared mutable capture cells across
  recursively nested lexical environments.
- VM-owned four-entry polymorphic caches for dynamic method call sites.
- Class-owned runtime shape chains with lazy instance field transitions.
- Value-carrying `raise` with source-mapped cross-call unwinding.
- Nested `begin`/`rescue` expressions with optional raised-value bindings.
- Primitive and subtype-aware nominal filters on rescue bindings.
- Pipe-separated rescue type sets with up to eight alternatives.
- Shape-guarded polymorphic inline caches for instance field reads and writes.

## Next priorities

1. Standard exception classes and `ensure`.
2. Generic collection annotations and general unions.
3. A small core library implemented partly in Diamond.

## Later experiments

- Modules/mixins and singleton methods.
- Bytecode quickening and type-specialized instructions.
- Fibers and cooperative concurrency.
- Structural interfaces and more capable flow typing.
- Native-code generation or a tracing/method JIT.
- Self-hosting selected compiler and standard-library components.

## Explicitly deferred

- Ruby compatibility.
- Stable bytecode and embedding APIs.
- Package management.
- Multi-platform support.
- Parallel execution.
