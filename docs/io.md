# I/O

Diamond has no file access or sockets yet. This document covers what
exists today (stdout and stdin) and will grow as later slices land (see
`docs/roadmap.md`).

## stdout: `print`/`puts`

```ruby
print("hello, ")
puts("world")
```

`print(value)` writes `value`'s stringified form to stdout with no
trailing newline; `puts(value)` writes it with one. Both take exactly one
argument and both return `nil`.

Stringification reuses the exact mechanism string interpolation (`#{}`)
and the `DIAMOND_OP_TO_STRING` opcode already use, via a shared
`stringify_value` helper in `src/vm.c`: a `String` value passes through
unchanged; an instance with a `to_s()` method has it called (and its
return value must be a `String`, or a rescuable `TypeError`); everything
else falls back to the same formatter used by string interpolation
(`nil`, `true`/`false`, integers, and `[...]`/`{...}` for arrays/hashes).
A `to_s` with the wrong arity raises a rescuable `ArgumentError`, exactly
as calling it any other way would.

`print`/`puts` are recognized in the compiler's `parse_name`, the same
place `Fiber.new` and `redefine_method` are — gated on the identifier not
already being a local or a user-defined function, so `def print(x) ...
end` shadows the builtin entirely (no reserved keyword). They compile to
a single `DIAMOND_OP_PRINT dest, source, newline` instruction; `newline`
is a compile-time-constant byte (`0` for `print`, `1` for `puts`), not a
runtime value.

## stdin: `gets()`

```ruby
name = gets()
puts("hi #{name}")
```

`gets()` takes no arguments and reads one line from stdin, returning it
as a `String` with the trailing line ending stripped — both `\n` and
`\r\n` are handled, and stripping happens on the accumulated line rather
than per underlying read, so it's correct regardless of where an
internal buffer boundary happens to fall relative to the ending. Returns
`nil` only when zero bytes were read before EOF; a final line with no
trailing newline still returns its content, matching Ruby's `gets`.
Compiles to a single `DIAMOND_OP_GETS dest` instruction. Recognized with
the same shadowing precedent as `print`/`puts`.

Line length is not capped — reading grows a buffer across as many
underlying `fgets` calls as a line needs, the same growable-buffer
pattern (`StringBuilder`) already used for value formatting elsewhere
in `src/vm.c`.

## What's deliberately out of scope so far

- **Files**: no way to open, read, or write a file yet.
- **Sockets**: needed before the Rack-style web server idea on the
  roadmap is possible at all.
- **Multiple `print`/`puts` arguments**: `puts(a, b)` (Ruby-style, one
  line per argument) is not supported — exactly one argument, matching
  the narrowest useful slice.
- **Error handling for write failures**: a failed `fwrite`/`fputc` to
  stdout (e.g. a broken pipe) is not currently surfaced as a rescuable
  exception; this mirrors most languages' baseline `print`, but is a
  known simplification, not a deliberate design stance.

Each of these is a plausible next slice, sized independently rather than
attempted together.
